A button that performs an action, with support for loading states and confirmation dialogs.

## Installation

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://acme.com/r/action-button.json
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

This example shows a simple action button that simulates a network request.

<div className="my-4 p-4 border rounded-lg flex justify-center">
  <ActionButtonExample />
</div>

```tsx
import { ActionButton } from "@/registry/new-york/blocks/action-button";

export function ActionButtonExample() {
  const handleAction = async () => {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    // Here you would typically make an API call
    console.log("Action completed!");
    return { error: false };
  };

  return <ActionButton action={handleAction}>Perform Action</ActionButton>;
}
```

### With Confirmation

You can require a confirmation dialog before performing the action.

<div className="my-4 p-4 border rounded-lg flex justify-center">
  <ActionButtonWithConfirmationExample />
</div>

```tsx
import { ActionButton } from "@/registry/new-york/blocks/action-button";

export function ActionButtonWithConfirmationExample() {
  const handleAction = async () => {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    console.log("Action completed!");
    return { error: false };
  };

  return (
    <ActionButton
      action={handleAction}
      requireAreYouSure
      areYouSureDescription="This will perform a destructive action. Are you sure?"
    >
      Delete Item
    </ActionButton>
  );
}
```
